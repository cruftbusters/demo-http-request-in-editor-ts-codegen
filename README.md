# demo-http-request-in-editor-ts-codegen

This demo showcases how to generate Typescript methods
from [HTTP Request in Editor](https://github.com/JetBrains/http-request-in-editor-spec/blob/master/spec.md) format. The
target outcome is to generate reliable bindings for remote APIs instead of manually maintaining these bindings in
repositories where HTTP Request in Editor format is already established to formally describe collaboratoring remote
APIs.
